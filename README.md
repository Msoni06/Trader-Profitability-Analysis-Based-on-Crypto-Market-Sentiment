# Data Scientist Salary Prediction

This project aims to predict the salary of data scientists based on various job-related factors. The entire data science lifecycle is covered, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to model building and evaluation.

## Project Workflow
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and parsed important information from the job description column (e.g., Python, R, AWS).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized the relationships between salary and factors like job title, location, company size, and specific skills.
3.  **Model Building:** Developed and compared several regression models to predict salary, including:
    - Linear Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the models using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to identify the best-performing one. The Random Forest model yielded the most accurate predictions.
